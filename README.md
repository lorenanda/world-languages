### Description

I started this project in order to combine my education in linguistics with my interest in data science. I find it fascinating that there are over 6000 languages in the world, each expressing the world view and cultural aspects of a group of people. However, due to various socio-political reasons, only a few languages dominate the global communication and are passed on to generations, while many others die out in time. 

I set out to explore the data of endagered languages to answer the following questions:
- in what geographical areas are most endangered languages found?
- how many language families, languages, and dialects are endangered, and to what extent?
